                        Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (Bengali: শেখ মুজিবুর রহমান; 17 March 1920 –
                        15 August 1975), shortened as Sheikh Mujib or just Mujib, was a
                        Bangladeshi politician and statesman. He is called the "Father of
                        the Nation" in Bangladesh. He served as the first President of
                        Bangladesh and later as the Prime Minister of Bangladesh from 17
                        April 1971 until his assassination on 15 August 1975.[1] He is
                        considered to be the driving force behind the independence of
                        Bangladesh. He is popularly dubbed with the title of "Bangabandhu"
                        (Bôngobondhu "Friend of Bengal") by the people of Bangladesh. He
                        became a leading figure in and eventually the leader of the Awami
                        League, founded in 1949 as an East Pakistan–based political party
                        in Pakistan. Mujib is credited as an important figure in efforts
                        to gain political autonomy for East Pakistan and later as the
                        central figure behind the Bangladesh Liberation Movement and the
                        Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. Thus, he is regarded "Jatir
                        Janak" or "Jatir Pita" (Jatir Jônok or Jatir Pita, both meaning
                        "Father of the Nation") of Bangladesh. His daughter Sheikh Hasina
                        is the current leader of the Awami League and also the Prime
                        Minister of Bangladesh.
